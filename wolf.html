                                       the film industry) married Hazel Hastings and could
                                       provide a stable home.</p>

                                       From an early age, he worked hard to avoid his famous
                                       father's shadow. In young adulthood, his father discouraged
                                       him from show business, and he attended business college and
                                       became successful in a Los Angeles appliance corporation.
                                       Creighton, who had begun working for a plumbing company,
                                       married Dorothy Hinckley, the daughter of his employer
                                       Ralph Hinckley. They had two sons: Lon Ralph Chaney and
                                       Ronald Creighton Chaney.

                                       Creighton's life changed forever when his father was diagnosed
                                       with throat cancer and died on August 26, 1930, at the age of 47.
                                       Many articles and biographies over the years report that
                                       Creighton was led to believe his mother had died while he was a boy
                                       , and he only made aware she lived after his father's death.
                                        Creighton always maintained he had a tough childhood.

                                        by Curt Siodmak and produced and directed by George Waggner.
                                        The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. in the title role.
                                        The title character has had a great deal of influence on Hollywood's
                                        depictions of the legend of the werewolf.The film is the second
                                        Universal Pictures werewolf film, preceded six years earlier by the
                                        less commercially successful Werewolf of London (1935). This film is
                                        part of the Universal Monsters movies and is of great cinematic acclaim
                                        for its production.

                                        After this movie's success, Lon Chaney Jr. would reprise his
                                        classic role as "The Wolf Man" in four sequels, beginning with
                                        Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man in 1943.

                                        Stories about the makeup and transformation scenes have become
                                        legendary and are mostly apocryphal. The transformation of Chaney
                                        from man into a monster was certainly laborious; the entirety of
                                        the makeup took five to six hours to apply.
